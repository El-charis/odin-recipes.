    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>

        Baileys French toast is made of fluffy, sweet challah bread soaked in a Baileys-infused egg wash and topped with a decadent chocolate and Baileys sauce. Itâ€™s easy to make, and the Irish cream offers so much flavor that you barely need to add any other ingredients. 


    </p>
    <p>
        Challah or brioche bread works best for this recipe since they are thick, rich, and already have great flavor. However, you can use another bread of your choice. Thinner, less sturdy bread will need less time soaking in the egg wash and will have a shorter cooking time.
