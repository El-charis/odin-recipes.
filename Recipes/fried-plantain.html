    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fried ripe plantains have a crispy, caramelized texture and irresistibly sweet taste. It's a ubiquitous Caribbean dish that is served with almost every meal, and it's enjoyed in other parts of the world as well. This is a quick and easy recipe that is sure to bring the taste of the Caribbean into your home.

Plantains are a member of the banana family. Unlike a banana, plantains are starchy and need to be cooked before eating. As a plantain ripens, its starches are converted to natural sugars, resulting in a sweeter taste. Frying a fully ripe plantain quickly in oil coaxes all the sugar to the surface where it's caramelized.

        <li>Gather the ingredients.

            
         
            
            
           <li>Ingredients for fried ripe plantains gathered
            Peel plantains by cutting off both ends, and cutting a slit down the side of each plantain.
            
        </li>
        <li>
            One hand holding the plantain and the other hand using a chef's knife to make a cut down the long side of the plantain
            Remove the plantain peel by peeling it side to side rather than lengthwise. It will come off in sections. You may need to use the knife at the edge of each section to help loosen it from the flesh. 
            
        </li>
        <li>
            Removal of the plantain peel by grabbing each side with one hand
            Cut the peeled plantains into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Diagonally is preferred because it provides a larger surface for caramelization; it can be cut straight across into rounds.
            
        </li>
        <li>
            Plantains cut into diagonal 1/4-inch-thick slices on a cutting board
            Drizzle just enough oil into a nonstick skillet to coat the bottom of the pan, and place it on medium heat.
            
        </li>
        <li>
            When the oil begins to shimmer, but not smoke, add plantains (work in batches). Fry for 1 1/2 minutes on one side, flip and cook for 1 minute on the other side.</li>
        
        </li>

    </ul>
